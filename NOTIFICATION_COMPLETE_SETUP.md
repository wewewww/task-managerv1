# 🔔 Complete Notification Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status

**Great news!** Your notification system is already implemented and the Firebase functions have been deployed. Now we just need to complete the final configuration steps.

### What's Already Done:
- ✅ **Notification functions deployed** (morning, afternoon, evening, overdue alerts)
- ✅ **Frontend notification service** implemented
- ✅ **Service worker** configured
- ✅ **UI integration** complete
- ✅ **Firebase project** on Blaze plan (required for scheduled functions)

## 🚀 Final Setup Steps

### Step 1: Generate VAPID Key (Required for FCM)

1. **Go to Firebase Console**
   - Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/todo-tracker-2ec93
   - Navigate to: **Project Settings** → **Cloud Messaging**

2. **Generate Web Push Certificate**
   - Scroll down to **"Web Push certificates"** section
   - Click **"Generate Key Pair"**
   - Copy the **VAPID key** (starts with `BP...`)

3. **Add to Environment Variables**
   - Create `.env.local` file in the `todo-tracker` directory:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY=BP_your_vapid_key_here
   ```

### Step 2: Test the Notification System

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Browser Notifications**
   - Open the app in Chrome/Firefox
   - Allow notifications when prompted
   - Create a task with today's or tomorrow's due date
   - You should see an instant notification

3. **Test FCM Token Generation**
   - Open browser console
   - Check for FCM token generation
   - Verify token is saved to Firestore

### Step 3: Deploy to Production

1. **Update Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Add environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY`
   - Set the value to your VAPID key

2. **Deploy the updated app**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "🔔 Complete notification system setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

## 🔔 Notification Schedule

Your app will now send notifications at these times (Paris time):

- **🌅 8:00 AM**: Daily summary of today's tasks
- **☀️ 1:00 PM**: Reminder of incomplete today's tasks  
- **🌙 6:00 PM**: Today's pending + tomorrow's tasks
- **⚠️ 9:00 AM**: Overdue task alerts

   ```

2. **Check FCM Token**
   ```bash
   # In browser console
   const messaging = getMessaging();
   getToken(messaging).then(token => console.log('Token:', token));
   ```
