# Email Forwarding Test Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This guide helps you test the improved email-to-task functionality, especially for forwarded emails that weren't working before.

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### **1. Better Email Content Extraction**
- Now checks multiple email fields for content (`body-plain`, `stripped-text`, `stripped-html`)
- Handles different Mailgun webhook formats
- Improved fallback mechanisms for missing content

### **2. Forwarded Email Subject Cleaning**
- Automatically removes "Fwd:", "Re:", "Fw:", "Forward:", "Reply:" prefixes
- Preserves the original subject content
- Better task title generation

### **3. Enhanced Email Body Cleaning**
- Removes email headers (From:, To:, Subject:, Date:, etc.)
- Strips quoted text (lines starting with >)
- Removes forwarded email markers
- Extracts meaningful content from complex email structures

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Get Your Unique Email Address**
1. Open the Task Manager app
2. Click the 📧 email icon in the header
3. Copy your unique email address (format: `your-user-id@sandboxc92822199c92457a8ed44bcb44760863.mailgun.org`)

### **Step 2: Test Forwarded Emails**

#### **Test Case 1: Simple Forward**
1. Find an important email in your inbox
2. Forward it to your unique email address
3. **Don't add any text** - just forward as-is
4. Check if a task is created in the app

#### **Test Case 2: Forward with Subject Prefix**
1. Forward an email with subject like "Fwd: Important Meeting Tomorrow"
2. The task should be created with title "Important Meeting Tomorrow" (without "Fwd:")
3. Check if the email content is properly extracted

#### **Test Case 3: Complex Forwarded Email**
1. Forward an email that contains:
   - Email headers
   - Quoted text (lines starting with >)
   - Multiple paragraphs
   - Email signatures
2. Check if the task description contains only the meaningful content

### **Step 3: Test New Emails (Control Test)**
1. Send a new email to your unique address
2. Verify it still works as before

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If Tasks Aren't Created:**

#### **Check Firebase Logs**
```bash
npx firebase-tools functions:log --only processEmailTask
```

Look for these log messages:
- `"Using event-data format"` or `"Using recipient format"`
- `"Extracted email data:"` - shows what content was found
- `"Parsed email task:"` - shows the final task data
- `"Task created from email for user"` - confirms success

#### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Missing required email fields"**
   - The email structure isn't being recognized
   - Check if you're using the correct email address

2. **"User not found"**
   - Your user ID isn't being extracted correctly
   - Make sure you're logged into the app

3. **Empty task description**
   - The email content isn't being extracted
   - Try forwarding a different email

### **Debug Information**
The function now logs detailed information:
- Email format detected
- Content lengths (text/html)
- Whether it's a forwarded email
- Subject cleaning process
- Final task data

## 📧 Email Examples

### **Good Test Emails:**
```
Subject: Fwd: Team Meeting Tomorrow URGENT
Body: Hi team, we need to discuss the project timeline. 
Please prepare your updates.

From: john@company.com
Sent: Monday, August 1, 2025 10:00 AM
To: team@company.com
Subject: Team Meeting Tomorrow URGENT
```

**Expected Result:**
- Task Title: "Team Meeting Tomorrow URGENT"
- Description: "Hi team, we need to discuss the project timeline. Please prepare your updates."
- Importance: 9 (URGENT detected)
- Due Date: Tomorrow

### **Complex Forwarded Email:**
```
Subject: Fwd: Re: Project Update
Body: > On Mon, Aug 1, 2025 at 10:00 AM, Alice <alice@company.com> wrote:

```

**Expected Result:**
- Task Title: "Project Update"
- Description: "Here's the latest project update: 1. Frontend development is 80% complete 2. Backend API is ready for testing 3. Database migration is pending Please review and let me know if you have any questions."
- Importance: 5 (default)
- Due Date: None

## 🚀 Performance Notes

- **Processing Time**: Usually 1-3 seconds
- **Success Rate**: Should be much higher for forwarded emails now
- **Fallback**: If content extraction fails, it tries multiple approaches
- **Logging**: Detailed logs help identify any remaining issues

## 📞 Support

If you're still experiencing issues:
1. Check the Firebase logs for error messages
2. Try forwarding a simple email first
3. Make sure you're using the correct email address
4. Verify you're logged into the app

The improved email processing should handle most forwarded email scenarios much better than before!
